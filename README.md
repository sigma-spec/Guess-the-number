# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple Python console game created as a beginner programming project.

## Description
The program generates a random number from 1 to 10.  
The player has three attempts to guess the correct number.  
After each attempt, the game gives feedback whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

The project was created to practice basic programming concepts such as:
- conditional statements (if / else)
- user input handling
- integer comparison
- basic game logic

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the program using the command:
   python guess_game.py

## Game Rules
- The computer chooses a number between 1 and 10.
- The player has 3 attempts to guess the number.
- If the number is guessed correctly, the player wins.
- If all attempts are used, the game reveals the correct number.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my first steps in Python programming and my ability to apply basic logical structures in practice.
